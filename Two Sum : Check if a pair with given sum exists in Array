Problem Statement: Given an array of integers arr[] and an integer target.
                   1st variant: Return YES if there exist two numbers such that their sum is equal to the target. Otherwise, return NO.
                   2nd variant: Return indices of the two numbers such that their sum is equal to the target. Otherwise, we will return {-1, -1}.
                   Input Format: N = 5, arr[] = {2,6,5,8,11}, target = 14
                   Result: YES 


Approach : First, we will use a loop(say i) to select the indices of the array one by one. For every index i, we will traverse through the remaining array using another loop(say j) to find the other number such that the sum is equal to the target (i.e. arr[i] + arr[j] = target).





import java.util.*;

public class Main {
    public static String twoSum(int n, int []arr, int target) {
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for (int j = i + 1; j < n; j++) {
                if (arr[i] + arr[j] == target) return "YES";
            }
        }
        return "NO";
    }

    public static void main(String args[]) {
        int n = 5;
        int[] arr = {2, 6, 5, 8, 11};
        int target = 14;
        String ans = twoSum(n, arr, target);
        System.out.println("This is the answer for variant 1: " + ans);
    }

}
