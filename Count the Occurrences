Problem Statement :Count the Occurrences of a Specific Number in an Array
                   Example, Input:{1, 2, 3, 4, 2, 2, 5}
                            Output: The number 2 appears 3 times.

Approach (Brute force)1️⃣ Initialize a Counter: Create a variable count = 0 to store the number of times the target appears.
                      2️⃣ Loop Through the Array: Use a for loop (enhanced for-loop) to check each element in the array.
                      3️⃣ Compare Each Element: If the current element matches the target number, increase the count (count++).
                      4️⃣ Print the Result: After the loop ends, print the final count of occurrences.

public class CountOccurrences {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] arr = {1, 2, 3, 4, 2, 2, 5};
        int target = 2; 
        int count = 0; 

        for (int num : arr) { 
            if (num == target) { 
                count++;
            }
        }

        System.out.println("The number " + target + " appears " + count + " times.");
    }
}
