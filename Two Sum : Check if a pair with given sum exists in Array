Problem Statement: Given an array of integers arr[] and an integer target.
                   1st variant: Return YES if there exist two numbers such that their sum is equal to the target. Otherwise, return NO.
                   2nd variant: Return indices of the two numbers such that their sum is equal to the target. Otherwise, we will return {-1, -1}.
                   Input :  N = 5, arr[] = {2,6,5,8,11}, target = 14
                   Output:  YES 

Approach : First, we will use a loop(say i) to select the indices of the array one by one.
           For every index i, we will traverse through the remaining array using another loop(say j) to find the other number such that the sum is equal to the target
           (i.e. arr[i] + arr[j] = target).

public class Sum {
    public static String TwoSum(int n , int target, int arr[]){
        for(int i =0; i<n; i++){
            for(int j = i+1; j<n; j++){
                if(arr[i] + arr[j]==target);

                return "YES"; 
            }
        }
        return "NO"; 
    }
    public static void main (String []args){
        int n = 5; 
        int target = 14; 
        int arr[] = {2,6,5,8,11}; 
        String ans = TwoSum(n, target, arr );
        System.out.println(ans);
    }
}
