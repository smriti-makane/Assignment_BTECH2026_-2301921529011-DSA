Problem Statement : Move All Zeros to the End
                   Example, Input: {0, 1, 0, 3, 12}
                            Output: Modified Array, [1, 3, 12, 0, 0]
Approach: 1️⃣ Initialize a Pointer
             Create a variable index = 0 to keep track of the position where the next non-zero element should be placed.
          2️⃣ Move Non-Zero Elements Forward
             Loop through the array:
             If an element is not zero, place it at arr[index] and move index forward.
             This shifts all non-zero elements to the left side of the array.
         3️⃣ Fill the Remaining Positions with Zeros
             After all non-zero elements have been moved, the remaining positions should be filled with zeros.
             Use a while loop to set arr[index] = 0 until the end of the array.


import java.util.Arrays;
public class MoveZeros {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] arr = {0, 1, 0, 3, 12};
        int index = 0; 

        for (int num : arr) {
            if (num != 0) {
                arr[index++] = num;
            }
        }

        while (index < arr.length) {
            arr[index++] = 0;
        }

        System.out.println("Modified Array: " + Arrays.toString(arr));
    }
}
